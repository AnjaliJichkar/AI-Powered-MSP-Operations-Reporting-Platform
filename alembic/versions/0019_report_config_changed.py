"""One audit event type: `report_config_changed`.

Revision ID: 0019
Revises: 0018

A franchisee's report setting that decides what a render names
(`show_people_names`) is changed from the CLI, and the change marks every
current review of that client stale. That is a row on the record, with the
setting, the value and the reviews touched, by the same constraint swap 0014
and 0016 used for their event types.
